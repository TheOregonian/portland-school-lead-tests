# portland-school-lead-tests
This shows the results of lead-testing and follow-up remediation at Portland Public Schools. L1 is a first-draw of water tested for lead. The EPA recommends taking that water sample after the water has been sitting in the pipes for 6-8 hours, so the samples are normally taken first thing in the morning. L2 is a second-draw of water sampled for lead. The EPA recommends flushing the line for 30 seconds after the first draw to take the second draw. The EPA recommends action to reduce lead if a sample comes in above 15 parts per billion. These readings are given in that unit: parts per billion. When test results exceeded that threshhold, the results are shown in red. For tests after 2002, follow-up actions, and whether a follow-up lead test was performed to ensure lead had been reduced to 15 ppb or lower, are also shown in red. The district has not yet provided remediation data for the 2001 and 2002 tests.
