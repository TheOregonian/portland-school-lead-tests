# portland-school-lead-tests
Here are test results from water quality testing done in Portland schools in 2002 and in 2010 through 2012. L1 is a first-draw of water tested for lead. The EPA recommends taking that water sample after the water has been sitting in the pipes for 6-8 hours, so the samples are normally taken first thing in the morning. L2 is a second-draw of water sampled for lead. The EPA recommends flushing the line for 30 seconds after the first draw to take the second draw. The EPA recommends action to reduce lead if a sample comes in above 15 parts per billion. These readings are given in that units: parts per billion. The C1 and C2 samples were drawn and tested for copper.
